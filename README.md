# cultural-asset-mapping-project

### About this repo
This repository is used to do three main things:
- Host a webpage for the Economic Development Department's Cultural Asset Mapping Project
- Keep various resources for the project organized in one place
- Keep project-related discussions and action items organized in one place

### About the Cultural Asset Mapping Project
The goals of this project are to collect information about the locations of cultural assets across the City of Austin through crowdsourced mapping and then publish that information to data.austintexas.gov. A public web form will be used to gather the information during a specific survey period, then the data will be published to the portal. More information about the project will be published to http://cityofaustin.github.io/cultural-asset-mapping-project.
